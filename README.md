# knn_example
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) example,

In short for KNN: We can say that the predictions are made according to the similarity of the observations.

In this example, we did a KNN model setup, estimation, and model tuning.

What are the KNN Steps?

KNN Steps:
1-Determining the number of neighbors
2-Calculation of the distance between the unknown point and all other points
3-Sort the distances and select the closest k observations according to the determined k number
4-Classification, on the other hand, is most often given as the predictive value of the class, while the mean value of the regression is given as the predictive value.
