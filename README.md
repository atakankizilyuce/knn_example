# knn_example
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) example,<br>

In short for KNN: We can say that the predictions are made according to the similarity of the observations.<br>

In this example, we did a KNN model setup, estimation, and model tuning.<br>

What are the KNN Steps?<br>

KNN Steps:
1-Determining the number of neighbors<br>
2-Calculation of the distance between the unknown point and all other points<br>
3-Sort the distances and select the closest k observations according to the determined k number<br>
4-Classification, on the other hand, is most often given as the predictive value of the class, while the mean value of the regression is given as the predictive value.<br>
